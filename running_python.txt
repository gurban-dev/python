Before executing a Python program, make sure
that the file has been saved.

python3 <name_of_file>.py

E.g. hello_world.py

Remember that this command-line argument
must be executed in the same directory/folder
where the Python program is being stored.

The program is hello_world.py in this case.

It is simply the file containing the Python
source code.

Python files must always end in the ".py"
file extension and they are sometimes
referred to as programs.


To go into a particular directory:
cd <directory_name>

E.g.
cd python


To go up one directory level:
cd ..

Running Python in interactive mode:
python3

On Linux:
Click Ctrl + D or type "quit() and click Enter
to exit interactive mode.

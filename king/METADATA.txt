Initial Objective:
Write Python source code that reads from a column name
in a Microsoft Excel file and prints a statement
depending on the value in each row.

The system creates a metadata for the two excel files.
It's not thinking in terms of excel anymore.
An existing table inside the system.

The name of the sheet becomes the name of the database
whereas the name of the columns become the names of the
field in the database.

How can I add a stage where I write either SQL or Python
to access the ProductType column in the database table.
How can I refer to the data if it is no longer Excel?

Review Yes or No is the new column or field which will
house the new formula logic/Python conditional.

If the current GOC came from the previous, did its type change?

Fill out numbers 5-12.

GOC
prevous is the leftmost column in the table.
current

If previous_GOC and current_GOC are the same, return the table 
Left join because previous_GOC is our leftmost column.

PREVIOUS_GOC Is our primary key.

If you upload the data, the two tables should be joined.

Issue:
Upon failing, an error isn't outputed. The fail occurs silently.

Is a left join appropriate here?

We want to see if GOC has changed in terms of type which
is recorded in a separate column in the table.

PREV_vs_Vlookup is the name of a field/column in the
METADATA Excel spreadsheet.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM Data", con=engine)
df['ReviewYesorNo'] = np.where(df['ProductType']=='FX','Y','N')

For what kind of database table is this Python source code for?

Swayam is the system I am working with.
This could potentially be SQLAlchemy.

I am seeing the subsequent error:
ProductTypeReview, Error - name 'engine' is not defined

previous is the leftmost column in the table.

If previous_GOC and current_GOC are the same,
return the table.

Left join because previous_GOC is our leftmost column.

PREVIOUS_GOC Is our primary key.

We want to see if GOC has changed in terms of
type which is recorded in a separate column in
the table.

PREV_vs_Vlookup is the name of a field/column
in the METADATA Excel spreadsheet.

def PREV_vs_CURR_Vlookup(df, j_message):
  print(df['METADATA'].columns)

  df['METADATA']['PREV_vs_CURR_Vlookup'] = pd.merge(
    ['Previous'], ['Current'], how='left',
    on=['Current']['Current_GOC'],
    left_on=['Previous']['Previous_GOC']
  )

This is invalid Python. Here's why:

❌ ['Current']['Current_GOC']
This tries to access 'Current_GOC' from the list ['Current'],
which is a list with a string, not a dictionary or DataFrame.

Assuming the following:
df['METADATA']['Previous'] is a DataFrame that contains a
column 'Previous_GOC'.

df['METADATA']['Current'] is a DataFrame that contains a
column 'Current_GOC'.

What we likely want instead:
def PREV_vs_CURR_Vlookup(df, j_message):
  print(df['METADATA'].columns)

  df['METADATA']['PREV_vs_CURR_Vlookup'] = pd.merge(
    df['METADATA']['Previous'],
    df['METADATA']['Current'],
    how='left',
    left_on='Previous_GOC',
    right_on='Current_GOC'
  )

print(df['METADATA']['PREV_vs_CURR_Vlookup'])

However, this assigns an entire DataFrame (the result of
pd.merge(...)) into a single column named 'PREV_vs_CURR_Vlookup'.
That’s invalid unless the merged DataFrame has only one column.

Clarify:
Inside METADATA, there are two columns:

Previous or Previous_GOC

Current or Current_GOC

You want to merge these two (left join) columns on GOC names.

Then compare types, and store the result in a new column
PREV_vs_CURR_Vlookup.

That aligns with the earlier goal:
Detect if the GOC's type has changed from Previous to
Current, and store 'Yes' or 'No' in PREV_vs_CURR_Vlookup.

pd.merge() needs two DataFrames.

left_on and right_on take string column names.

how='left' in pd.merge() performs a left join, which works
like this:
Keep all rows from the left DataFrame, and match rows from
the right DataFrame where possible based on the join condition.

If there's no match in the right DataFrame, pandas fills the
missing values with NaN.

left_on='Previous_GOC', right_on='Current_GOC'

The above line tells pandas:
Look in the left DataFrame (Previous) for a column called
'Previous_GOC'.

Look in the right DataFrame (Current) for a column called
'Current_GOC'.

Form a new DataFrame by joining the rows where those values
match.

The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that
have matching values in both tables.

Format:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Keep in mind that INNER JOINs are sometimes
written without the keyword "INNER".

Table name: Products
ProductID   ProductName   CategoryID    Price
1	          Chais	        1	            18
2	          Chang	        1	            19
3	          Aniseed Syrup	2	            10

Table name: Categories
CategoryID   CategoryName   Description
1	           Beverages	    Soft drinks, coffees, teas, beers, and ales
2	           Condiments	    Sweet and savory sauces, relishes, spreads, and seasonings
3	           Confections	  Desserts, candies, and sweet breads

See rows containing values for the columns "ProductID",
"ProductName", and "CategoryName" from the database
table named "Products", but only for rows/records that
have the same value in the "CategoryID" column in both
tables.

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, CategoryName
FROM Products
INNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;

ProductID   ProductName     CategoryName

2	          Chang	          Beverages

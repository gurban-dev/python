1. Install the libraries office365, sharepy, requests,
   for interacting with SharePoint using Python:
   pip3 install office365 sharepy requests

   office365 provides access to SharePoint REST APIs, enabling
   operations such as reading, writing, and managing SharePoint
   resources like lists, files, and document libraries.

   A document library in SharePoint is a centralised repository
   where users can store, organize, share, and collaborate on
   documents.

   sharepy is supposed to simplify the process of interacting
   with SharePoint Online from Python through handling
   authentication for your SharePoint Online site.

2. Authenticate with SharePoint

   Use office365 or sharepy to connect to your SharePoint site
   and retrieve project collaborators.

   from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext

   def connect_to_sharepoint(site_url, username, password):
     ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_user_credentials(username, password)
     return ctx

3. Prompt the end user for the project name
   Ask the user to input the name of the project.

   project_name = input("Enter the name of the SharePoint project: ")

4. Retrieve collaborators from SharePoint
   Query the SharePoint list to get collaborators for the specified
   project.

   def get_collaborators(ctx, list_name, project_name):
     list_obj = ctx.web.lists.get_by_title(list_name)
     items = list_obj.items.filter(f"Project eq '{project_name}'").get().execute_query()
    
     collaborators = []
     for item in items:
       # Assuming 'Collaborators' is a field containing emails
       collaborators.append(item.properties['Collaborators'])

     return collaborators

5. Authenticate with Microsoft Graph API
   access_token = get_access_token(
     application_id=APPLICATION_ID,
     client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
     scopes=SCOPES
   )

6. Send emails to collaborators
   Use Microsoft Graph API to send emails.

   import requests

   def send_emails(access_token, collaborators):
     graph_url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/sendMail"
    
     for email in collaborators:
       message = {
         "message": {
           "subject": "Important Update for Your Project",
           "body": {
             "contentType": "Text",
             "content": "Hello,\n\nThis is an important update regarding your project."
           },
           "toRecipients": [{"emailAddress": {"address": email}}]
          }
        }
        
        headers = {
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        
        response = requests.post(graph_url, json=message, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 202:
          print(f"Email sent successfully to {email}")
        else:
          print(f"Failed to send email to {email}: {response.text}")

How can this program be altered to send a different email
body to members that are part of the quality assurance team?

1. Identify Quality Assurance Team Members: You need to identify
   which collaborators are part of the quality assurance team.
   This could be done by adding a field in your SharePoint list
   that indicates whether a collaborator is part of QA or not.

2. Modify the get_collaborators Function: Modify the
   get_collaborators function to also retrieve the QA
   status of each collaborator.

3. Modify the send_emails Function: Modify the send_emails function
   to send a different email body based on whether the collaborator
   is part of QA or not.

Step 1: Modify get_collaborators Function
Assuming you have a field named IsQA in your SharePoint list:

  @classmethod is called a decorator because it
  contains the @ character.

  cls is the conventional name for the first parameter
  of a class method in Python.

  Python automatically passes the class itself (cls)
  as the first argument to class methods.

  It is necessary to pass cls to a class method
  because Python will raise a TypeError when you
  try to call it without cls as the first parameter.'''

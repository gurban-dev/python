# Python's built-in print() function accepts one
# or multiple arguments and prints them to the
# screen.
print("Hello World!")

# Both double and single quotes can be utilised
# in Python for printing text to the screen.
print('Good morning.')

# Below on line 28, a variable named "name" is declared.
# This variable will store the value 'John' because
# the assignment operator (=) assigns the text 'John'
# to the variable.

# Remember that the value being assigned is located on
# the right side of the assignment operator (=) while
# the variable storing the value is located on the left.

# A variable can be thought of as a jar with a label
# attached to it that stores information.

# You can put something inside (like a number or word),
# and later open the jar to access that information or
# change what's inside.

# In this case, 'John' is being put into a jar labeled
# "name".
name = 'John'

# The print() function is accepting two arguments:
# "name:"
# name

# A comma (,) is used to separate arguments that are
# passed to the print() function.
print("name:", name)

# Python is an interpreted language, which means it uses
# a program called an interpreter to read and execute
# each line of code one at a time.

# Comments which begin with number signs (#) in Python,
# are ignored by the interpreter.

# Why write comments?
# If you come back to analyze your source code weeks
# or months later, you want to quickly comprehend what
# it does.

# If you are collaborating with colleagues on a team,
# writing comments also helps them understand your code
# and work with it more easily.

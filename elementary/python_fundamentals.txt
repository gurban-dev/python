Practice Questions
1. What is declared in Python to store data?
   Answer: Variables are declared in Python
           to store data.

2. How can the data type of a variable be identified?
   Answer: Look at the value being assigned to the
           variable.

3. How do you know if a value is an integer in Python?
   Answer: The value must be a number without a decimal
           and without quotes surrounding it.
           E.g. -1
4. How do you know if a value is a string in Python?
   Answer: The value must be enclosed or surrounded by
           either single or double quotes.
           E.g. '-1', "True"
5. What does typing python or python3 in the command-line
   load?
   Answer: The Python interactive shell.

6. What are all the following called in Python?
   Hint: Notice what all of these lines have in
         common.
   print()
   type()
   range()

   Answer: Since they all contain parentheses, these
           are known as functions.
7. What built-in function in Python returns the data
   type of the argument passed to it?
   Answer: type()

8. What does is the argument being passed to the type()
   function below?
   type('Copernicus')

   Answer: 'Copernicus'

given_name = 'Dennis'

no is an abbreviation for "number".
no_of_pizza_pies = 5

What you see to the left of the assignment operator
(=) is the variable name.

What you see to the right of the assignment operator
(=) is the value being assigned.

Two pieces of data are being stored here:
A person' given name (same meaning as first name).
The number of pizza pies they ordered.

given_name and no_of_pizza_pies are the variables
declared.

What is the data type of given_name and no_of_pizza_pies?
Since the variable given_name was assigned 'Dennis', it
is a string data type. Anytime you see data surrounded
by quotes, you can immediately conclude that the data type
is a string.

The variable no_of_pizza_pies was assigned 5. 5 is a whole
number and it is not surrounded by quotes. Therefore, it
can be concluded that no_of_pizza_pies is being assigned
an integer and is of the integer data type.

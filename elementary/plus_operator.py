# Remember that to call functions in Python,
# a pair of parentheses must be used: ()
# E.g. print()

# The values put inside of the parentheses are
# called arguments. Arguments are the data that
# are provided to functions.

# In this case, an integer is being provided to
# the print() function as an argument: 4
# 4 is the argument because 2 + 2 evalutes to 4.
# print(2 + 2) -> print(4)
print(2 + 2)

# The data type of a whole number without quotes
# is an integer.

'''
Notice how this time, the 2s are surrounded by
quotes: "2" + "2"

This means that instead of providing an integer
to the print() function, a string literal "22"
is being provided.

"22" is the argument being provided because
"2" + "2" evaluates to "22" in Python.

This is called string concatenation. Think of it
as making two characters stick together.
'''

# print("2" + "2") -> print("22")
print("2" + "2")

# print(5 + 5) -> print(10)
print(5 + 5)

# print("5" + "5") -> print("55")
print("5" + "5")

'''
The main takeaways here are:
When you put a + sign between two numbers, it means
you add them together.

But when you put a + sign between two words (pieces
of text), it means you stick them together to make
one longer word or sentence.

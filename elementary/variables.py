'''
= (called the equals sign in mathematics) is
called the assignment operator in programming.

The assignment operator assigns data:
flavour = 'vanilla '

'vanilla ' is the data being assigned. 'vannilla '
is a string literal because it is surrounded by
quotes on its left and right sides.

When you see data surrounded by quotes (single or
double quotes), you immediately know that you are
working with a string data type.

flavour is assigned the string literal 'vanilla '
which makes flavour a string variable.

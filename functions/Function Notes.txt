Built-in functions are predefined by Python:
print(), len(), type()

User-defined functions are created by the programmer:
def greet():
  print("Hello!")

Functions are different than methods.

# A built-in function.
print("Hello")

# A user-defined function.
def greet():
  print("Hi!")

A method is a function that belongs to an object.
(like a string, list, etc.).

A method of a string object.
"hello".upper()

A method of a list object.
[1, 2, 3].append(4)

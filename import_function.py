Hello all.

I am trying to comprehend the following steps for
importing a function that belongs to a module
located in a differen directory.

```
Python
| King
| | python_for_onedrive
| | | read_file.py
| | python_for_outlook
| | | outlook.py
```
1. Open VS Code in the project folder

2. Create a launch config using the Run option on the left

3. Edit it to add the env function

4. Ensure the folders have underscores not dashes

5. Run the file

And remember - this works only for the Run config.
Running the script in a separate console will break.

My questions about step 1:
Do I need to open VS code in King?
Or could I have opened it in Python?

Socket:
A socket is a software endpoint for communication
between two programs over a network, while TCP
(Transmission Control Protocol) is a protocol.

An endpoint refers to a unique combination of an
IP address and a port number that identifies a
specific location where network communication can
occur.

In this context, a protocol is a set of rules and
that govern how data is transmitted across a network.

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) suite is the foundation of modern network
communication.

It enables computers to communicate and share data
across local or wide-area networks like the Internet.

File descriptor:
In socket programming, a file descriptor is an integer
that represents an open socket, allowing a program to
interact with the network.

Objective:
To establish a TCP client-server interaction
where the client and server can communicate
with each other over a network.

Remember that in software engineering, the client
side is what the end user sees when they interact
with an application. The server-side is where the
business logic is located and processes the data
inputted by the end user.

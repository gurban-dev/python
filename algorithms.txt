An algorithm is a step by step approach to
solving a problem.

Requirements:
1. An algorithm must be unambiguous.
   Meaning that any two people should read it
   and arrive at the same conclusion.

   Unambiguous means not open to more than one
   interpretation.
2. An algorithm should have clearly defined inputs
   and outputs.
3. An algorithm should be language neutral, so that
   a Java developer and a Python developer can both
   understand or comprehend it.

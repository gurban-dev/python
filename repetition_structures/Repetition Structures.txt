Concept:
A repetition structure causes a statement or
set of statements to execute repeatedly.

Statements in this case are lines of code or instructions
that we are giving to the computer.

A section of source code will be executed more
than once.

They are needed in certain cases because programmers
have to write code that performs the same tasks
multiple times.

In Python, you use the while statement to write a
condition-controlled loop, and you use the for
statement to write a count-controlled loop.

A while loop is also called a pretest loop because it
tests its condition before performing an iteration.

During each iteration, source code or instructions
are executed.

A condition-controlled loop causes a statement or
set of statements to repeat as long as a condition
is true.

You want to write a while loop when validating user
input is necessary.
E.g. An end user is entering their date of birth.

A while loop has two parts:
(1) a condition that is tested for a true or false value
(2) a statement or set of statements that is repeated as
    long as the condition is true.

while condition:
  statement
  statement
  etc.

The first line is referred to as the while clause.


A count-controlled loop iterates a specific number
of times. In Python, you use the for statement to
write a count-controlled loop.

In Python, the for statement is designed to work
with a sequence of data items. When the statement
executes, it iterates once for each item in the
sequence.

[value1, value2, etc.] is an iterable because
the program can iterate or loop through each
of the elements/items it contains.

for variable in [value1, value2, etc.]:
  statement
  statement
  etc.

The first line is known as the for clause.
